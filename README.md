## Recommendations

We recommend using Visual Studio Code as an IDE. Typescript support is integrated by default.  
Also, it's fancy, lightweight, and free!  

https://code.visualstudio.com/

## Requirements

You must have installed Node.js in your machine to be able to run npm commands:
https://nodejs.org/es/

Be sure you can run all the commands in "How to use" section before the session.

## How to use

Just clone it and get going.

```
# --depth 1 removes all but one .git commit history
$ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ernifrontendcommunity/typescript-introduction.git <your-project-name>

# change directory to your project
cd  <your-project-name>

# Maybe remove the `.git` directory and start with a fresh one.

# install all dependencies.
$ npm i

# Start developing and serve your app:
npm start

# Build your app without minification: 
npm run build

# run unit tests:
npm run test-1
```
